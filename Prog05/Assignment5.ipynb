    "Above we see that the best tree provides clearly the best confidence interval, being between above 56% to 100% accuracy. This means that no matter what the accuracy of the model is most likely correct (since >50% gives positive odds). As the model is restricted, however, we can see the interval slip below 50% which would result in prediction to inevetably be wrong on some occasions."

Each teammate did equal amounts of work and deserves equal credit."
